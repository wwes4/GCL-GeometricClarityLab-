========================
Bipolar Lattice — 18 + 8 + 27 + 52 architecture

Structure:
  18 outer waypoints  — 9 positive tension amplifiers + 9 negative compression sinks
   8 structural waypoints — powers-of-2 scaffolding (square-triangle backbone)
  27 symbol ring      — outer crescent (A–Z + dynamic 0), 5 geometric stabilizers
  52 Mersenne strings — fold negotiators, 26 per polarity side

Golden zone — the innermost attractor region (structural waypoints at radius 0.35).
When semantic_tension is low (field is calm and resolved), the core election fires
and the highest-scoring waypoint in the golden zone becomes the active centre.

inject_semantic_tension() maps subject/verb/object hash IDs onto the Mersenne
strings using the odd/even vertical/horizontal asymmetry from the design notes:
  odd subject  → positive tension (+0.8)
  even verb    → negative compression (-0.6)
  object mod 3 → constructive interference (+0.4)

Self-selecting core: no displacer is born into the centre. Objective physics only.

Geometric roles (v3 — derived from sphere geometry and fold point theory):

  5 Geometric Stabilizers (formerly "vents"):
    The 5 triangle positions on the 27-symbol ring are the weakest points on
    the sphere — where the geometry will break first under stress. Their role
    is structural pressure relief: when total field tension approaches the
    break threshold, these points bleed off the excess proportionally.
    They are NOT fold points. They are safety geometry — the tissue paper
    tearing at its weakest seam before the whole sheet goes.

  52 Mersenne Fold Negotiators (formerly "tensegrity waveguides"):
    Each string runs its own incommensurable negotiation cycle, tracked via
    fold_phase. The Mersenne prime basis ensures no two strings share a period —
    their cycles never lock into the same rhythm, which is what prevents the
    lattice from going rigid (copy paper behavior). The bleed is not waste —
    it is the string finding its local equilibrium, the same way tissue paper
    finds the spiral under a string twist. Aggregate of 52 independent
    negotiations produces the emergent tensegrity field.

Spin State (v2):
  Every waypoint carries a signed rotational phase — spin_phase ∈ [0, 2π),
  spin_sign ∈ {+1, -1}.

  spin_sign assignment at construction (from zero dynamism design):
    odd  wp_id → +1  (builds vertically)
    even wp_id → -1  (recognizes horizontally)

  Each tension cycle advances spin_phase by asymmetric_delta × spin_sign.
  The cycle never closes perfectly — that residual is the arrow of time in
  the rotation domain. Spin direction survives tanh saturation because it is
  positional, not amplitude-based.

  The 8 structural (golden zone) waypoints maintain a ring net_phase sum.
  When that sum crosses a full 2π increment, one geometric tick fires —
  replacing wall-clock delta_t as the system's internal time measure.

  Core election gains a spin coherence bonus: candidates whose spin_phase
  aligns with the ring's net phase score higher, so the elected core
  is the node most in-phase with the field's current rotational state.

        when the field hasn't decided which way it's pointing.

        Each structural waypoint owns exactly one phase window — 1/8 of
        the full 2π spin cycle. Only the waypoint whose window contains
        the current ring_net_phase is eligible for election.

        no core is elected this cycle. The field stays coreless until
        the ring advances into a window whose waypoint has earned it.
