    Central Invariants Module - Clarity Ratio Laboratory

    Contains shared geometric and mathematical invariants used across the lab.

    Dual-13 Integer System:
      +1 to +13 on the positive side (odd vertical builders)
      -1 to -13 on the negative side (even horizontal recognizers)
      Zero sits at center — dual value (+1 AND -1 simultaneously).
      Zero is the only position that has not committed to a direction.
      When zero resolves it becomes either +1 or -1 — that resolution
      is what controls displacement engine braking. Zero deciding its
      direction is what starts or stops movement.

      Letter assignment (A–Z across ±1 to ±13):
        A=+1  B=+2  C=+3  D=+4  E=+5  F=+6  G=+7
        H=+8  I=+9  J=+10 K=+11 L=+12 M=+13
        N=-1  O=-2  P=-3  Q=-4  R=-5  S=-6  T=-7
        U=-8  V=-9  W=-10 X=-11 Y=-12 Z=-13
        '0' symbol → dual value: resolves dynamically per cycle

      Dynamic zero facilitation:
        Zero holds two integers (+1, -1) and maps to two letters (A, N)
        simultaneously until the field resolves its direction.
        The resolved value is determined by ring_spin_signal sign:
          positive spin → zero resolves to +1 (A side)
          negative spin → zero resolves to -1 (N side)
          zero spin     → zero remains unresolved (dual, both held)
